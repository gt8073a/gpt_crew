Starter templates for fast, personal GPT crew setups. Define roles, set voices, kill the glaze.

# From Blank to Specialized: Define Your Crew.
AI assistants aren’t broken — just blank.  
Without a role and a voice, they default to empty.  
Here’s how to build a Crew with something to say — and a point of view.

**Crew Definitions** give direction.  
Set a *role* (what your AI does) and a *voice* (how your AI speaks) to each member.  
Swap between members instantly. Stay sharp.


## Quick Start
1. Add the [crew prompt](prompts/crew-prompt.md) to Customize ChatGPT → "What traits should ChatGPT have?" field
2. Add the [starter crew list](crews/start-crew.md) to Customize ChatGPT → "Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?" field
3. Add [any other crew members](crews/) below the starting crew list
4. Save your customizations, and open a new chat.
5. Use `/crew` by itself to view your crew.
6. Use `/crew [name]` to switch between members.
7. `/crew soundoff [question]` lets your whole Crew answer at once.


## What is a Starting Crew?
A Starting Crew is a small set of 3–5 members — just enough to swap perspectives without slowing down.  
Each one has a clear role and voice, ready to jump in when needed.

## Why so few?
We're hijacking a few customization fields to always have multiple roles at our fingertips in a single chat.  
These fields are very limited in size, so you have to pick your Starting Crew


## Adding More Crew Members Later
You can always expand your Crew as you go.

There are three easy ways to do it:
1. Copy a new Crew member definition into your customization field during setup.
2. Upload a .md file with temporary member definitions into the current chat.
3. Use `/crew maker` to create a temporary member for the current chat.

Temporary members will stay active for the chat session, but won’t appear in future chats.
