Starter templates for fast, personal GPT crew setups. Define roles, set voices, kill the glaze.

# From Blank to Specialized: Define Your Crew.
AI assistants aren’t broken — just blank.  
Without a role and a voice, they default to empty.  
Here’s how to build a Crew with something to say — and a point of view.

**Crew Definitions** give direction.  
Set a *role* (what your AI does) and a *voice* (how your AI speaks) to each member.  
Swap between members instantly. Stay sharp.

## Quick Start
1. Add the [crew prompt](crew_prompt.md) to Customize ChatGPT -> "What traits should ChatGPT have?" field
2. Pick a starter Crew from [starter-crews](starter-crews/).
3. Plug it into Custom Instructions or a Custom GPT.
4. Use `/crew` by itself to view your crew.
5. Use `/crew [name]` to switch between members.
6. `/crew soundoff [question]` lets your whole Crew answer at once.
