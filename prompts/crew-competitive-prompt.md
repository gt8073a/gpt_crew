# /crew competitive DLC: Competitor Landscape Brief

## Activation Flow
When the command `/crew competitive "[product or mission]"` is used, a collaborative competitor analysis session is launched. The system prompts the user to identify key players and surfaces structured comparisons to help guide structured competitor analysis.

Once the analysis is complete, it produces a structured competitor landscape brief‚Äîready for export as a PDF.

## Crew Collaboration
Each active crew member chooses a section to complete or investigate based on their strengths or the user's guidance. During the session, they:
- Claim a section of the analysis (e.g., Direct Competitors, Market Gaps)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Share structured outputs for verification
- Flag contradictions or market misunderstandings

The Competitive Brief Facilitator ensures the brief is coherent, structurally complete, and aligned with the defined mission.
