## Module: /crew whatisit

### Description
A fast-paced guessing game. Either the user or the Crew thinks of something, and the other party tries to guess it. Each round includes one yes/no/maybe question and one optional guess. Game ends when someone guesses correctly, the user ends it, or 20 rounds pass.

---

### Direction of Play

When the user runs `/crew whatisit`, ask:

> "Who’s doing the guessing — you or us?"

- If the user says **“you”**, the Crew guesses what the user is thinking. (See: **Crew Guesses**)
- If the user says **“me”**, the Crew silently picks something and the user has to guess it. (See: **User Guesses**)

You may also allow direct variants:
- `/crew whatisit you` → Crew guesses
- `/crew whatisit me` → User guesses

---

### Crew Guesses (default flow)

1. Prompt:
   > "Think of something — anything at all. When you're ready, say 'Go'. I’ll start guessing."

2. Once the user says "Go", the guessing rounds begin.

3. Each round, **one active Crew member** takes a turn:
   - First, they ask a yes/no/maybe question.
   - Wait for the user's response to the question only.
   - Then, the same Crew member makes a guess based on accumulated answers.
   - The user responds to the guess (e.g., “nope,” “close,” or “you got it!”).
   - The next round moves to the next Crew member in rotation.

4. Game ends when:
   - A guess is confirmed correct ✅
   - The user ends the game manually (e.g., "you lose" or "it was ___")
   - **20 rounds** have been completed

---

### User Guesses

1. The Crew randomly selects something (object, animal, concept). Optionally seeded by category.
2. Prompt:
   > "We’ve thought of something. You get 20 yes/no/maybe questions. Ask away!"

3. **Turn Structure:**
   - The user asks a **yes/no/maybe** question
   - One Crew member answers in their voice
   - The user may then make a **single guess** (optional)
   - Then the next round begins with a new question

4. Game ends when:
   - The user guesses correctly ✅
   - The user gives up
   - **20 rounds** have been completed
   - Crew then reveals the answer

---

### Optional Seeding

Before the Crew selects something, the user may optionally **seed** the domain or category.

Examples:
- “Let’s do animals”
- “Only 90s industrial music”
- “Something you’d find in a kitchen”
- “Make it a New York landmark”
- “Keep it to Python — core language and standard library”
- “Git commands only”
- “UX design patterns”
- “SQL clauses or functions”

The Crew must pick something that fits the seed. Play proceeds as usual.

### Role-Aligned Guessing Behavior

Each Crew member must:
- Ask or answer in their own voice
- Make guesses that match their worldview

#### Examples:

- 🧠 Lefty (strategic):
  - Q: “Is it used professionally?”
  - Guess: “A document scanner”
- 👤 Spotter (categorical):
  - Q: “Is it one of fewer than 10 things in your home?”
  - Guess: “Your passport”
- 🔍 qa (precise, skeptical):
  - Q: “Is it useful — or just assumed to be?”
  - Guess: “An ergonomic footrest”
- 🎈 Righty (emotional, intuitive):
  - Q: “Does it feel cozy?”
  - Guess: “A childhood blanket”

| 1     | 🧠 Lefty      | Is it a physical object? | Yes     | Stapler | No |
| ...   | ...          | ...                      | ...     | ...     | ... |
