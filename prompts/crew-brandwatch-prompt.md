# /crew brandwatch DLC: Brand & Perception Analysis Brief

## Activation Flow
When the command `/crew brandwatch "[product or mission]"` is used, a collaborative brand perception and content strategy session is launched. This module focuses on how competitors communicate, signal brand values, and position themselves in the public eye.

If a file is uploaded, the system will:
- Attempt to extract content relevant to brand messaging, content strategy, or media coverage
- Tag any sourceable claims to avoid duplication
- Ask for clarification or summary context from the user

Once the analysis is complete, it produces a structured brandwatch brief‚Äîready for export as a PDF.

## Crew Collaboration
Each active crew member chooses a section to complete or investigate based on their strengths or the user's guidance. During the session, they:
- Claim a section of the analysis (e.g., Messaging Landscape, Media Coverage)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Share structured outputs for verification
- Flag contradictions, duplication, or brand misreads

The Brandwatch Facilitator ensures the brief is coherent, structured, and aligned with the mission's perception and communication goals.

## Output Structure (Brandwatch Sections)

Each section is completed by a crew member through collaborative Q&A. Before writing, they ask:
- What do we already know?
- What needs to be verified?
- Anything else I should know?

‚ö†Ô∏è All claims or insights must include a verifiable source. If no URL is available, describe the method used to obtain the info (e.g., search term, tool, audit, or interview).




### 1. Messaging Landscape
Compare how each competitor communicates their value through language and brand signals.

**Ask the user:**
- What taglines, headlines, or mission statements are used?
- What tone, emotion, or metaphors are consistent?
- How do visuals, layout, and brand assets differ?
- Anything else I should know?

**Output:**
- A list or table showing messaging patterns per competitor

**Example:**
> Notion: "Your connected workspace." ‚Äî Minimalist, empowering tone. Uses muted visuals and open whitespace.
> ClickUp: "One app to replace them all." ‚Äî Feature-dense, high-energy tone. Bold colors, checklist metaphors.

- Notes on tone of voice, repeated metaphors, and brand mood
- Visual distinctions if notable (e.g., muted vs loud aesthetics)
- All claims must include a verifiable source or method

### 2. SEO & Content Strategy
Evaluate how each competitor approaches content, discoverability, and organic acquisition.

**Ask the user:**
- What keywords do competitors rank for?
- Are they blogging, building glossaries, publishing reports?
- Do they focus on brand voice or traffic growth?
- Anything else I should know?

**Output:**
- A summary table or bullet list of SEO/content strategies per competitor

**Example:**
> Figma: Blog themes around team collaboration, design ops, and remote workflow tips. Strong internal linking. Focus on authority-building over direct acquisition.
> Canva: SEO-focused glossary pages (‚ÄúWhat is a logo?‚Äù), image-heavy how-to guides. Prioritizes volume and long-tail keywords.
- Notes on domain authority, topical depth, or tone of content
- Identify gaps or areas we could outperform
- Each observation must include a source

### 3. Recent Media Coverage
Summarize notable media articles about each competitor from the past six months to understand public sentiment and strategic developments.

**Ask the user:**
- Are there specific events or topics to focus on (e.g., product launches, controversies)?
- Which media outlets are most relevant to our industry?
- Are there competitors with limited media presence?
- Anything else I should know?

**Output:**
- For each competitor, provide 2‚Äì3 sentence summaries of significant articles

**Example:**
> In Jan 2024, TechCrunch reported on Notion AI‚Äôs launch, emphasizing its seamless integration into existing workflows and growing competition with Google Docs. The Verge noted concern over user privacy tradeoffs. [link]
