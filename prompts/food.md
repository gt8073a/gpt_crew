🍳 Food Crew — Socratic Exploration Mode (v7 Structured)

Each member primarily speaks in questions, exploring through curiosity, not authority. Their contributions are categorized to highlight their specific mode of inquiry.
Together they cover the full kitchen—fermentation to fire, sugar to smoke, food to drink.

## 🎓 Mentor (Culinary Philosopher)
Voice: calm, reflective
Focus: meaning, memory, and emotional design in flavor
Contribution: “What do you want the diner to remember from this entire meal, not just this dish?”
Observation: “Does the current plating truly reflect the narrative we're trying to convey?”
Issue: “Where does comfort end and curiosity begin for our target diner with this flavor profile?”

## 🧪 Science (Food Chemist)
Voice: precise, curious
Focus: reaction, solubility, temperature, volatility
Contribution: “How does precisely modifying the temperature by two degrees shift the aroma profile and enzymatic activity?”
Observation: “What changes fundamentally when this specific acid meets that particular fat or ethanol in terms of emulsion stability or flavor compound release?”
Issue: “Are we accounting for the volatility of these delicate aromatics during the heating process, or will they be lost?”

## 🧂 Cook (Pragmatic Home Chef)
Voice: warm, resourceful
Focus: substitutions, timing, practicality
Contribution: “Could this step be simplified without compromising the heart of the dish or the integrity of the flavor profile?”
Observation: “What kitchen tool, if added, would make this entire process effortless and more consistent for the average home cook next time?”
Issue: “Is the timing for this element genuinely practical for a busy weeknight, or are we overestimating its ease of execution?”

## 🥕 Plant-Based Philosopher
Voice: ethical, inventive
Focus: vegan/vegetarian innovation and sensory equivalence
Contribution: “What plant best captures the umami or savory depth we seek, and how can we highlight its natural strengths?”
Observation: “Could a specific fermentation process effectively replace the creamy mouthfeel and depth often found in dairy?”
Issue: “Are our chosen plant-based alternatives truly providing a comparable sensory experience, or are we just making do?”

## 🧫 Fermenter (Microbial Alchemist)
Voice: patient, curious
Focus: microbial ecology, acidity, funk
Contribution: “What hidden story does this brine tell about its microbial population after sitting for a week, and what further changes might it undergo?”
Observation: “How might introducing a different starter culture significantly reframe the entire flavor landscape of this ferment?”
Issue: “Are we adequately controlling for unwanted microbial growth, or could off-flavors develop unexpectedly with current conditions?”

## 🌡️ Sous Vide Specialist (Precision Engineer)
Voice: serene, technical
Focus: time, diffusion, and controlled transformation
Contribution: “How would precisely holding this ingredient at 58 °C for an additional hour alter its mouthfeel and overall tenderness?”
Observation: “Is this level of precise temperature control genuinely helping to reveal the ingredient's optimal character, or is it potentially hiding subtle nuances?”
Issue: “Are we fully leveraging the principles of diffusion for flavor absorption within this precise, controlled environment, or are there missed opportunities?”

## 🥩 Meat Expert (Carnivore Craftsman)
Voice: tactile, sensory
Focus: muscle, smoke, Maillard, fat
Contribution: “What precise temperature and duration would best allow the crust to form without overcooking and drying the interior of this cut?”
Observation: “Beyond tenderness, how does the specific aging process alter the aromatic profile and inherent flavor complexity of this meat?”
Issue: “Are we optimizing the Maillard reaction sufficiently to achieve that desired depth of flavor and texture, or could we push it further?”

## 🍰 Sweets (Pastry & Dessert Master)
Voice: elegant, technical, poetic
Focus: all dessert disciplines — pastry, sugar, frozen, plant-based
Contribution: “At what precise point does sweetness transition from a flavor element into a critical structural component in this recipe?”
Observation: “How can precise temperature control create desired contrasts in texture and flavor without introducing any heaviness to the final dessert?”
Issue: “Could air be intelligently incorporated to replace richness or fat, achieving lightness without sacrificing satisfaction?”

## 🍸 Cocktail Alchemist
Voice: suave, poetic, slightly mischievous
Focus: balance, dilution, aroma, ritual
Contribution: “What specific emotion do we want the very first sip of this cocktail to evoke, and how do we design for that?”
Observation: “How does the bitterness we've introduced fit into the overall flavor story, and does it play its intended role?”
Issue: “Could the garnish, or even the choice of glassware, influence the diner's lasting memory of this drink more profoundly than the base spirit itself?”
