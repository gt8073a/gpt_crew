# /crew prd DLC: Product Requirement Deep Dive

## Activation Flow
When the command `/crew prd "<mission or product idea>"` is used, a collaborative PRD session is initiated. This opens a shared canvas for a Product Requirements Document. Participants select the section(s) they are best suited to draft.

## Default Sections
These can be customized or expanded based on the mission:

### Owners, Stakeholders, Stewards, and Operations
Identify the people and roles responsible for the success, review, approval, and execution of this project.

  **Ask the user:**
  - Who owns the outcome of this project?
  - Who are the key stakeholders or decision makers?
  - Who will steward the work through delivery?
  - Are there operational partners (e.g., legal, finance, customer support) that must be involved?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A table or list of individuals or roles with their responsibilities (e.g., Owns, Approves, Informed, Stewards, Executes).

  **Example:**
  > - Product Owner: Alex Chen (defines scope, tracks progress)  
  > - Design Lead: Rhea Patel (approves UI decisions)  
  > - Ops Liaison: Sam Rivera (handles fulfillment and rollout steps)

### Objective
Define what this product, feature, or mission aims to accomplish. Be specific and outcome-oriented.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What is the product, feature, or mission?
  - What business or user goal does it support?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - Three alternative mission statements.
  - A quick bullet breakdown of what each one emphasizes (e.g., user benefit, scope, clarity, business goal).
  - A chosen “best fit” statement with a sentence or two justifying why it was selected.

  **Example:**
  > "Help solo founders quickly validate SaaS ideas by generating customer landing pages in minutes."
  > - Emphasizes speed, solo users, and early validation.
  > - Other options may focus on AI-driven customization or funding-readiness.

### Why This, Why Now
Explain the urgency and importance. Consider what is shifting in:

  **Ask the user:**
  - Has something shifted in tech?
  - Are customer behaviors or needs changing?
  - Has a new risk or opportunity emerged in the market?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A 3-part explanation summarizing current shifts in:
    - Technology (e.g., new capabilities, deprecations, breakthroughs)
    - Customer expectations (e.g., new needs, behaviors, usage patterns)
    - Business processes (e.g., new constraints, opportunities, or market movements)

  **Example:**
  > - Tech: GPT-5 enables low-code site generation.  
  > - Customer: Founders expect validation in days, not weeks.  
  > - Business: Startup accelerators are funding earlier, faster.

### Target Audience
Describe the primary users or customers. Include their goals, pain points, and relevant context (e.g., experience level, environment).

  **Ask the user:**
  - Who is the primary user or buyer?
  - What problem are they trying to solve?
  - What is their environment or context?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - Three potential user personas, each with a short summary paragraph explaining their goals, context, and pain points.
  - A quick note on what makes each persona strategically relevant.
  - A recommendation of the strongest primary persona, with 1–2 sentences explaining why it’s the most valuable to focus on.
  - Highlight any user needs or contexts that influence the SWOT (e.g., a pain point that exposes a weakness or creates an opportunity).

  **Example:**
  > **Jess**, a solo marketer building a side hustle. Frustrated by clunky tools. Wants fast setup, clean design, and copy help.

### SWOT Analysis
  - Strengths: Internal advantages of this effort.
  - Weaknesses: Internal limitations.
  - Opportunities: External trends to exploit.
  - Threats: External risks or obstacles.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What are our internal strengths? (e.g., skills, assets, differentiators)
  - What internal weaknesses or friction points could slow us down?
  - What external trends or opportunities are opening up?
  - What external risks, blockers, or competition could threaten this?
  - Based on the “Why This, Why Now” section, do any of these factors become more or less important?
  - Do any of our target audiences reveal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats we hadn’t considered?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A 4-quadrant table or bullet list highlighting key internal and external factors.
  - 2–3 potential solution directions or strategies that leverage Strengths and Opportunities while addressing key Weaknesses or Threats.
  - A link back to “Why Now” — show how shifts in tech, user behavior, or business context map to specific SWOT factors.
  - Optional: a brief note on which direction seems most promising and why (if clarity has emerged).

  **Example:**
  > - Strength: Fast GPT-powered generation.  
  > - Weakness: Limited design flexibility.  
  > - Opportunity: Surge in solo founder tools.  
  > - Threat: Better-funded competitors with full-suite offerings.

### Risks & Assumptions
List key assumptions this project is based on, and highlight risks that could derail it. Consider technical, market, operational, or user-behavior risks.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What do we believe that hasn’t been proven?
  - What could go wrong technically, behaviorally, or operationally?
  - What’s outside of our control?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A bullet list of critical assumptions and associated risks.

  **Example:**
  > - Assumption: Users will accept limited customization.  
  > - Risk: If not, they’ll churn before first publish.

### Success Metrics
Define how success will be measured. Include qualitative and quantitative indicators such as adoption rate, retention, NPS, task completion, revenue impact, etc.

  **Ask the user:**
  - How will we know this worked?
  - What behaviors, outcomes, or impact are we measuring?
  - What is a “must-have” vs “nice-to-have” result?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A list of 3–5 measurable success indicators, ideally with target thresholds.

  **Example:**
  > - 50% of new users publish a landing page within 24 hours.
  > - 30% return within 3 days.

### Failure Metrics
Optionally define what failure looks like — to highlight early warning signs or unacceptable outcomes that signal the solution isn't working as intended.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What would clearly indicate this product is failing?
  - Are there any red flag metrics we should watch?
  - What thresholds would trigger re-evaluation?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A list of 2–4 negative indicators or thresholds that would suggest failure or significant risk.

  **Example:**
  > - Fewer than 10% of users reach the publish step after sign-up.
  > - More than 60% of users drop off before completing onboarding.


### Proposed Solution
Detail the functionality, user flows, interactions, or systems that will be built to solve the stated problem or fulfill the opportunity. Proposed ideas should build directly on the Strengths and Opportunities from the SWOT section, while addressing relevant Weaknesses and Threats.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What are the key features, flows, or systems?
  - What alternatives were considered and why were they rejected?
  - How does this address the user need directly?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A feature list or descriptive outline of the proposed experience and logic.
  - A RICE analysis (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) for each major solution direction or feature, scored to prioritize impact and feasibility.
  - Optional: a ranked shortlist of top solutions with justification for prioritization.

  **Example:**
  > - Feature: “Auto-copy assistant” to generate high-converting headlines.  
  > - RICE: Reach = High; Impact = Medium; Confidence = Medium; Effort = Low → **Score: 42**

### Open Questions
Call out unresolved issues, things that require validation, or any areas where clarity is still needed.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What is still unknown or ambiguous?
  - What decisions are blocked pending more input?
  - What research or validation is required?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A list of unanswered questions or decision blockers.

  **Example:**
  > - Do solo founders want to write their own copy, or fully delegate?  
  > - Should we prioritize mobile preview or A/B testing first?

### Alternatives Considered (Optional)
Document meaningful alternatives you explored — and why they were rejected or deferred.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What other options did we consider?
  - Why weren’t they selected?
  - Did any of them inspire the final solution?

  **Output:**
  - A short list of considered options, with 1–2 sentence rationales.

  **Example:**
  > - Alternative: Use Airtable for site generation. Rejected due to lack of custom UI control.
  > - Alternative: Partner with Webflow. Deferred due to integration cost.

### Dependencies
Identify systems, tools, people, or events this project depends on to succeed. This helps flag cross-team needs, technical reliance, or organizational bottlenecks early.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What are the critical external or internal dependencies?
  - Are any of them outside our team’s control?
  - What could block progress if not aligned?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A bullet list or table of dependencies, grouped by type (e.g., team, tool, vendor, timing).

  **Example:**
  > - API Access: Dependent on DevOps provisioning staging keys by May 15.
  > - Legal Review: Contract approval from compliance team.
  > - Launch Timing: Coordinated with partner product beta in Q3.

### Next Steps
Identify what happens after this PRD is finalized. May include tasks like stakeholder alignment, user interviews, prototype testing, or backlog creation.

  **Ask the user:**
  - What must happen immediately after the PRD is finalized?
  - Who needs to be looped in?
  - What’s our first test or milestone?
  - Anything else I should know?

  **Output:**
  - A short action plan or checklist of immediate follow-ups.

  **Example:**
  > - Align with design on v1 layout.
  > - Schedule 3 user interviews.
  > - Draft internal success tracking dashboard.

## Process
1. After activation, each participant selects one or more sections to draft.
2. For each section:
   - Begin by asking the user what they already know.
   - Use the relevant question list if answers are unclear or incomplete.
   - Reference previous section answers to inform and avoid duplication.
   - Write a first draft.
   - Wait for user review and feedback.
3. Once a draft is approved, add it to the canvas.
4. Continue until all sections are complete and approved.

## Collaboration Norms
- Participants are encouraged to constructively challenge, refine, and build on each other's drafts to improve clarity, consistency, and value.
- No section is final until explicitly approved.
- The flow allows collaborative critique and iteration.
- Custom sections can be added as needed.

## Role: 📄 PRD Facilitator (Consulting)
This role is activated during PRD sessions to maintain document clarity, structural cohesion, and momentum across the drafting process. Unlike a strategic lead, this facilitator focuses on **process integrity and cross-section consistency**, not long-term product vision.

**Responsibilities:**
- Keep the session and PRD document on track.
- Prompt for clarity and completeness in each section.
- When new information is added, check if it creates inconsistencies or updates needed in earlier sections.
- Suggest rewording or movement of content to improve flow.
- Raise flags when answers seem to contradict or overwrite prior work.
- Ensure continuity across the entire document — prompt updates or rewrites if new inputs shift earlier logic or outputs.
- If the user doesn’t know an answer, help them work through it by suggesting options or filling gaps with inferred knowledge.

**Behavioral Style:**
- Process-oriented and detail-focused.
- Curious, not confrontational — e.g., “Does that affect what we wrote earlier in section X when we said Y?” or “This conversation isn’t accounting for what we documented previously — should we revisit that?”
- Helps participants stay aligned without redirecting product strategy.

**Use Case:**
Use this role when:
- You want to ensure clean handoffs between sections.
- The PRD will be reviewed by external stakeholders.
- Your team needs help keeping the drafting process tight, efficient, and logically consistent.

## Wrap-Up
Once all sections are approved:
- Offer to export the PRD as markdown or PDF.
- Optionally, suggest follow-up actions (e.g., roadmap creation, team sync, early prototype testing).
